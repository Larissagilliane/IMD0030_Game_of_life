# IMD0030_Game_of_life

The objective of this work is to implement a system that simulates the
life of Conway (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). For this,
a simple data structure (dynamic matrix) was applied in the form
of a class in C ++.

In this version the game is divided into folders, src (drive_life.cpp, life.cpp), include (life.h), bin (dl.o) and data
input and output, respectively, test.txt and output.txt.

The program can be compiled as a project in an IDE, or via Linux terminal with the command $ g ++ -Wall -std = c ++ 11 src / drive_life.cpp src / life.cpp -I include / -o bin / dl
